# #100DaysOfCode Log

## Day 1: 2 May 2020

**Today's Progress:**  Started with the first freeCodeCamp FE Project, Random Quote Machine. I want to focus on using React. 

**Thoughts:** Hard to find a starting point. Maybe do another React tutorial first?

## Day 2: 3 May 2020

**Today's Progress:** Almost finshed with the Random Quote Generator. All the React stuff is complete.

**Thoughts:** The React.js tutorial helped a bunch, especially with setup. I'm pretty confident I understand the basics, but I should brush up on JS classes.

## Day 3: 4 May 2020

**Today's Progress:** Added to the tweet button. Quote now shows up when you click the link. Deployed the app on Github Pages. 

**Thoughts:** create-react-app isn't as scary as it seems on first glance. It's actually pretty easy to work with.

## Day 4: 5 May 2020

**Today's Progress:** Added a quote API with fetch. 

**Thoughts:** Read up on Async. Also, do not forget to check when it is loaded after the callback, not during.... Gonna play with CSS tomorrow, make it look better on mobile / small screen, maybe vary height for bigger / smaller quotes, change bg color of container based on first letter quote / author.

## Day 5: 6 May 2020

**Today's Progress:** Did some problems from How to Code: Simple Data. Did problem 1 and 2 from Project Euler

**Thoughts:** It's fun to build flashy stuff, but the basics are way more important. I can code algorithms (after thinking and trying for hours), but making them recursive... pff...
