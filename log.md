# #100DaysOfCode Log

## Day 1: 2 May 2020

**Today's Progress:**  Started with the first freeCodeCamp FE Project, Random Quote Machine. I want to focus on using React. 

**Thoughts:** Hard to find a starting point. Maybe do another React tutorial first?

## Day 2: 3 May 2020

**Today's Progress:** Almost finshed with the Random Quote Generator. All the React stuff is complete.

**Thoughts:** The React.js tutorial helped a bunch, especially with setup. I'm pretty confident I understand the basics, but I should brush up on JS classes.

## Day 3: 4 May 2020

**Today's Progress:** Added to the tweet button. Quote now shows up when you click the link. Deployed the app on Github Pages. 

**Thoughts:** create-react-app isn't as scary as it seems on first glance. It's actually pretty easy to work with.

## Day 4: 5 May 2020

**Today's Progress:** Added a quote API with fetch. 

**Thoughts:** Read up on Async. Also, do not forget to check when it is loaded after the callback, not during.... Gonna play with CSS tomorrow, make it look better on mobile / small screen, maybe vary height for bigger / smaller quotes, change bg color of container based on first letter quote / author.

## Day 5: 6 May 2020

**Today's Progress:** Did some problems from How to Code: Simple Data. Did problem 1 and 2 from Project Euler

**Thoughts:** It's fun to build flashy stuff, but the basics are way more important. I can code algorithms (after thinking and trying for hours), but making them recursive... pff...

## Day 6: 7 May 2020

**Today's Progress:** Learned about lists from How to Code, did a algo project on FCC, added a color changing state? and played around with some CSS

**Thoughts:** Only got one more thing I want to add to the Random Quote project, but I might just put it on hold and start a new project tomorrow. I want to start with the Pomodoro clock project, because that's actually usefull.

## Day 7: 8 May 2020

**Today's Progress:** Did some FCC challanges

**Thoughts:** Didn't really feel like doing anything, but I did work at some (3) algorithm problems.

## Day 8: 9 May 2020

**Today's Progress:** Went through basics of Objects again

**Thoughts:** Have to read up on more basic JS things, because I've forgotten some basic usefull stuff

## Day 9: 13 May 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started the Library project on The Odin Project

**Thoughts:** Wasn't motivated to code the last few days. But once I started reading / studying, I got sucked in and spent a few hours with Object Inheritance / Prototype Chain / This keyword. I wanna make a web app with database which contains info on all my houseplants, esp watering schedules. I also want to add a way to alert me if and which plants need watering. Also, making notes in markdown is way nicer than making notes in google docs.

## Day 10: 14 May 2020

**Today's Progress:** Did How To Design about Reference, played around with a render function for the Odin Project Library

**Thoughts:** The project is slowly getting along, because I have to Google every thing I want to try. Hopefully I'll start remembering DOM manipulation methods. I do know most methods used in "normal" functions, it's just the "rendering" I'm having trouble with.
